CompuCell3D Reference Manual - 3.7.8
======================================================
The focus of this manual is to teach you how to use CC3DML (XML-based syntax) to build powerful multi-scale
multi-cell tissue simulations. We will assume that you have a working knowledge of XML.
You do not have to be an XML guru but you should know how to write simple XML documents
