CC3DML Syntax of CompuCell3D modules
====================================

This CompuCell3D reference material provides users with fairly detaild
description of CC3DML syntax (CC3DML is XML-based model description
format) of CC3D modules. The presented material is indended for users
who are already familiar with CompuCell3D basics and know how to build
and run simple simulations such as cell-sorting, bacterium macrophage or
cell-type-oscillator. Since we often show CC3DML syntax and accompanying
Python syntax for CC3D scripting we assume that users are familiar with
Python. For readers who are using CompuCell3D for the first time we
strongly recommend reading “Introduction To CompuCell3D”. Complete
description of CC3D Python scripting can be found in “CC3D Python
Scripting Manual”. Both manuals are available from
`www.compucell3d.org <http://www.compucell3d.org>`__ or at your nearest
bookstore.
